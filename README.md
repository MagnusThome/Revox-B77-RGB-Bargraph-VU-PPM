# Replacement LED bargraph VU & PPM for Revox B77
### "Full RGB" LED display that can show either VU, PPM or VU+PPM simultaneously

I bought myself an old Revox B77 that needed some fixing. Mainly as a fun project, I have always wanted a two track high speed B77. Among other things the left VU meter was broken. The spool winding was broken and despite my best efforts I just couldn't get a hold of the tail end of the extemely thin spool wire to re-attach it. So looking around on the internet for an oem spare part VU meter I found that they have been out of production for a while and the prices have sky rocketed. With shipping and VAT just one meter would cost me $250. And since it was said that, in worst case, they can differ ever so slightly in color and look, there was a small risk that I would need to buy two. So I decided why not have a bit of fun instead designing some pcb with schematics and code, as yet another hobby project!  

All files are here on GitHub for you to order an empty pcb, the front panel (which also is just a regular pcb) and the electronic parts for you to assemble, solder and load the code on to.

## Some examples of color and display modes:
  
In the pictures below the display is in program mode (shown by a white LED being turned on in the lower part of left display). You can choose between:
- VU (dot)
- VU (bar)
- PPM (dot)
- PPM (bar)
- VU (bar) and PPM (dot)
  
Different color schemes are easily added, some distinct and some more oddball color schemes are already in the code.
